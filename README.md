# tikz-figures
A collection of TikZ figures to illustrate concepts in maths and physics.

The figures can be produced by running `make` within each subfolder.
For producing the pdf files, you need a distribution for the TeX typesetting system, such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html).
An alternative is to use an online LaTeX editor, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
